[Dynamic Programming] [Subset sum]

You can choose no more than ‚åäùëö/2‚åã elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their
sum is divisible by ùëò and this sum is the maximum.

dp(i)(j)(c)(r) = ith row, jth column, having included c elements from the ith row, with remainder r, the max sum achievable

We do this expansion style, this would mean that when we reach a cell we update those forward next affected by it.
Row transition, when at the last element of a row, we update the next dp(i+1)(0)(0)(r)

This problem differs from subset sum in that we don't the full value for the last dimension instead only the remainder
