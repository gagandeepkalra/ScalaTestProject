Purely Functional Competitive programming in Scala.

Most programs would contain a description(or link) of the underlying problem solved and adheres to the same strict run time limit from codeforces

Going purely Functional takes a speed hit because of frequent memory requests of newer copies from immutable data. In most of the programs here I have tried avoiding mutation but you'll still find me using a mutable map or set somewhere limited to a scope.
